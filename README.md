### Requirements

You'll need to have nanomsg installed beforehand.

## Getting Started

This library is Cargo supported! Simply add a new cargo dependency and
away you go!

```toml
[dependencies.nanomsg]
git = "https://github.com/thehydroimpulse/nanomsg.rs"
```

Now you can use the crate after you include it:

```rust
extern crate nanomsg;
```

## Creating a Socket (Push/Pull)

The basis of Nanomsg is a `Socket`. Each socket can be of a certain type. The type of a socket defines it's behaviour and limitations (such as only being able to send and not receive).

```rust
use nanomsg::{Socket, Protocol, NanoResult};

fn initialize() -> NanoResult<()> {
    let mut socket = try!(Socket::new(Protocol::Pull));
    let mut endpoint = try!(socket.bind("ipc:///tmp/pipeline.ipc"));

    loop {
        let msg = try!(socket.read_to_string());
        println!("We got a message: {}", msg.as_slice());
    }
}

fn main() {
    initialize();
}
```

As you can see, we bind a socket to an endpoint. These resources are destroyed correctly at the end of their lifetime, closing the bound socket.

We can also create a client to that socket. The `Pull` protocol is one that can only receive (push/pull), so we need the accompanying socket `Push` for this to work correctly (or to get a message in the end).

(For now, we'll create them as separate binaries because of some threading issues with nanomsg)

```rust
use nanomsg::{Socket, Protocol, NanoResult};

fn initialize() -> NanoResult<()> {
    let mut socket = try!(Socket::new(Protocol::Push));
    let mut endpoint = try!(socket.connect("ipc:///tmp/pipeline.ipc"));

    socket.write(b"message in a bottle");

    endpoint.shutdown();
}

fn main() {
    initialize();
}
```
