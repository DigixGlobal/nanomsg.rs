## Requirements

## Getting Started

This library is Cargo supported! Simply add a new cargo dependency and
away you go!

[dependencies.nanomsg]
git = "https://github.com/thehydroimpulse/nanomsg.rs"
```

Now you can use the crate after you include it:

```rust
extern crate nanomsg;

use nanomsg::Nanomsg;
```
