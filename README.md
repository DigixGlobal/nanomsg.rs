### Requirements

* Nanomsg 0.5.0

Installing nanomsg:

```
make deps
```

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
nanomsg = "^0.3.3"
```

Simply import the crate to use it:

```rust
extern crate nanomsg;
```

## Creating a Socket

The basis of Nanomsg is a `Socket`. Each socket can be of a certain type. The type of a socket defines it's behaviour and limitations (such as only being able to send and not receive).

```rust
use nanomsg::{Socket, NanoResult, Protocol};

/// Creating a new `Pull` socket type. Pull sockets can only receive messages
/// from a `Push` socket type.
fn create_socket() -> NanoResult<()> {
    let mut socket = try!(Socket::new(Protocol::Pull));
    Ok(())
}
```

Now, each socket that is created can be bound to *multiple* endpoints. Each binding can return an error, so
we'll take advantage of the `try!` macro.

```rust
use nanomsg::{Socket, NanoResult, Protocol};

/// Creating a new `Pull` socket type. Pull sockets can only receive messages
/// from a `Push` socket type.
fn create_socket() -> NanoResult<()> {
    let mut socket = try!(Socket::new(Protocol::Pull));
    
    // Create a new endpoint bound to the following protocol string. This returns
    // a new `Endpoint` that lives at-most the lifetime of the original socket.
    let mut endpoint = try!(socket.bind("ipc:///tmp/pipeline.ipc"));

    Ok(())
}
```

The socket is ready to be used now!

Because this is a `Pull` socket, we'll implement reading any messages we receive.

```rust
// ... After the endpoint we created, we'll start reading some data.
loop {
    let msg = try!(socket.read_to_string());
    println!("We got a message: {}", &*msg);
}
// ...
```

That's awesome! But... we have no packets being sent to the socket, so we'll read nothing. To fix this, let's implement
the accompanying pair `Push` socket.

```rust
use nanomsg::{Socket, Protocol, NanoResult};

fn pusher() -> NanoResult<()> {
    let mut socket = try!(Socket::new(Protocol::Push));
    let mut endpoint = try!(socket.connect("ipc:///tmp/pipeline.ipc"));

    socket.write(b"message in a bottle");

    endpoint.shutdown();
}
```
